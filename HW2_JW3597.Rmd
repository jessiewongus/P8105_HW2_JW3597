Problem 1: 
```{r}
# Read the csv for problem 1
nyc_transit = read_csv(file = "./data_files/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
```

```{r}
# Cleaning the data from the CSV:

# Cleaning the variable names after import: The variable names were changed to lower snake case
nyc_transit = janitor::clean_names(nyc_transit)
names(nyc_transit)
```

```{r}
# Specifying the range of columns to keep: retaining line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance
select(nyc_transit, line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)


# Converting entry variable from character to a logical variable 
nyc_transit$entry <- as.logical(recode(nyc_transit$entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE"))
View(nyc_transit$entry)

# How many distinct stations are there?
name_line = distinct(nyc_transit, station_name, line)
nrow(name_line)
# There are 465 distinct stations.

ada_compliant = distinct(nyc_transit, station_name, line, ada)
filter(ada_compliant, ada == "TRUE")
# There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant. 

# What proportion of station extrances/exits without vending allow entrance?

```


```{r}
# read the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet
library(readxl)
trash_wheel = read_excel("../data_files/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N258")

# omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
na.omit(trash_wheel, cols  = "Dumpster")
